ProofChecker
------------

ProofChecker automatically checks given in file proof.

To check proof in file filename.txt execute (without arguments ProofChecker will try to read proof from file proof.txt):

    java -jar ProofChecker-executable.jar filename.txt
    
ProofChecker-executable.jar file can be found from ./ProofChecker/target/ folder:  https://github.com/PolarHare/MathLogic/blob/master/ProofChecker/target/ProofChecker-executable.jar

proof.txt - example file with proofs can be found in root folder:  
https://github.com/PolarHare/MathLogic/blob/master/proof.txt

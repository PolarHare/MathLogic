Some programs for checking mathematical logic proofs, automatically proof statements and so on.

ProofChecker
------------

ProofChecker automatically checks given in file proof.

To check proof in file filename.txt execute (without arguments, ProofChecker will try to read proof from file proof.txt, that contains three proofs and located in root folder):

    java -jar ProofChecker-executable.jar filename.txt
    
ProofChecker-executable.jar file can be taken from ./ProofChecker/target/ folder:
